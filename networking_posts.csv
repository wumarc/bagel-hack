Entry level hopecore. I got a job.,"I got an entry job. I started looking for jobs at 21, I‚Äôll be 24 in September. Literally only posting this to help all those people almost about to give up as I was. 

Originally went medical device route. 5 runner up interview cycles. All multiple months, requiring travel, presentations etc. runner up for associate roles every single time to established people like physical therapists, etc, being forced to go for associate or Jr. roles due to the job market.

Graduated in three years with my bachelors. Have spent the entire duration since working as a personal trainer at 4am, taking marketing courses, networking my absolute tail off on LinkedIn, social events, making portfolios, taking people to coffee, clubs, job fairs, and it finally paid off- entry level marketing job through connections. Work from home. No legit experience besides social media. A good manager who took the time to listen to what I know and can do. 

Keep trying. Keep networking. it takes ONE person to listen.",32,2025-03-21 19:29:20,2,0.046577380952380946

Feeling stuck after months of job search-  9 years of work exp- need advice & support,"Hello All, 

Feeling Stuck After Months of Job Searching ‚Äì Need Advice & Support

After months of job hunting on LinkedIn, Indeed, and Naukri, I‚Äôm reaching out because I‚Äôm almost out of my safety net, my RSUs and savings are nearly gone.

I have 9 years of experience as an Operations and Program Manager in the FMCG and Trust & Safety industries. I‚Äôve led global projects to expand business operations, managed a team of 40 escalation specialists, and driven performance through KPIs and coaching methodologies. I have hands-on experience in scaling up businesses from scratch and have built teams and processes from the ground up. I pride myself on being an empathetic leader who balances business needs with people development. Having started as an associate myself, I‚Äôve learned through every challenge along the way.

I hold a Lean Six Sigma Certification from ISI and a Certified Scrum Master (CSM) certification from Scrum Alliance.

In 2023 July, I took a planned break to get married and move to another country, but things didn‚Äôt go as expected. Legal hurdles and personal challenges forced me to return to India, and now I‚Äôm struggling to get back on my feet.

If anyone has advice, referrals, or opportunities, I‚Äôd really appreciate it. This has been a tough journey, and I‚Äôm open to any insights that could help. I am happy to relocate to any place and open to remote work too. 

(Side note: I also have 5 years of social volunteering experience in sustainable education initiatives, and started a sports club for football at workplace for all genders to encourage social exposure n build teamwork. something I‚Äôm deeply passionate about.)",3,2025-03-22 03:58:41,0,0.03765432098765432
Not hearing back after a phone screening. What should I do?,"
I had a phone screening about 1.5 weeks ago with a company I applied to. It went well, basically her just describing the job and what I would be doing, asked about my salary expectations, and when I could start. 

She told me the next step will be her and the hiring manager going over my application (and I assume other candidates as well) and then they will reach out to me once a decision for a final interview is made. 

I emailed a day after the phone screen interview basically saying ‚ÄúThank you for the call, please reach out if you have questions about me, my resume, or my experience‚Äù just to keep me in their mind. 

It‚Äôs coming up on 2 weeks now and it‚Äôs been radio silence. The longer I don‚Äôt hear back the more discouraging it seems.

What should I do? Do I send another email? Do I just wait? I don‚Äôt want to be too pushy. ",1,2025-03-22 09:55:55,5,0.075

Where am I supposed to find a job?,"Applied to jobs with one basic resume, no response (not even a rejection email). Tailored my resume to fit each job, no response. Used AI to write my resume and CV, no response.

Talked to job staffing agencies. Just told me that they don't have anything for my skill set. I have been in sales, administrative, and analyst positions for the past 8 years. With a bachelor's degree in business (I know it's worthless).

Tried to go network in person. They just brush me off when I don't have a specific skill or certification.

Tried reaching out to friends and family, but it seems none of them have any faith in me to refer me to a low level position.

This is my ""Lost Faith"" moment and I have no idea where to turn. Every time I tell someone that it's impossible to find work, who has had a job for the past decade, they look at me like I am crazy, dumb, or not trying hard enough. Everyone keeps telling me, ""That's crazy"" or ""You are applying outside your skill set/worth"". I am not. Like everyone else, I have applied to fast food, day labor, janitorial, and anything else you can think of as bottom of the totem pole jobs. I don't even get a response. It's like there is a cyber wall blocking my applications from going through. I can't believe I am getting no response. I tried reaching out to the company's I applied to and they just said you have to apply online and we will reach out. There has to be something out there. Unless I have some sort of criminal charge or a disclaimer attached to my name that says, ""DO NOT HIRE"". I have no clue. I took a break from applying so I could start feeling hopeful again and would actually sound cheerful when talking to potential employers again, but it's the same. I don't get discouraged easily so the fact that I feel this way, is saying something.

Why does this happen?,"Decades in manufacturing and I‚Äôm convinced we‚Äôre living in a Kafka novel.

Manufacturing is chaos on repeat. One month it‚Äôs ‚ÄúMANDATORY OVERTIME OR ELSE,‚Äù and the next, you‚Äôre perfecting the ancient art of broom-pushing because there‚Äôs nothing to build but you still have to ‚Äúlook busy.‚Äù

The setup? Classic corporate pyramid scheme. Owner at the top raking it in, management layers below, then us‚Äîthe people who actually make the product that pays everyone's salary.

Here‚Äôs where it gets downright absurd:
When things slow down, it‚Äôs us‚Äîthe lowest-paid, hardest-working folks‚Äîwho get stuck doing busywork to ‚Äújustify‚Äù our jobs. Cleaning stuff that doesn‚Äôt need cleaning. Inventing tasks out of thin air. Meanwhile, the higher-ups? Meetings, coffee, LinkedIn browsing, and pretending Outlook is hard to use.

So let me get this straight:
The people who physically create the thing your company sells‚Ä¶ have to ‚Äúfind stuff to do,‚Äù while the folks collecting bigger paychecks for PowerPoint decks and vague ‚Äústrategy‚Äù sit comfortably doing next to nothing?

How is this still the norm? How is everyone not screaming from the rooftops?

Corporate logic: Where those who do the least get paid the most, and those who do the most get to ‚Äúlook busy.‚Äù

Make it make sense.

"How do you get around job websites that only let you upload one version of your resume to your profile, if you want to apply for different roles?","Maybe I just need to vent. I moved to the US a year ago (family based) and received my work permit a week ago. I was already anxious about having over a year of unemployment on my resume, but I am also attempting to change industries as my new city doesn't have a lot/any jobs in my old sector.

I'm keeping an open mind - I just need a job. I'll take nearly any office job. I've been looking at data entry clerk positions as I think I would be suited to that, but I'm also putting out feelers for the possibilty of a remote job in my old field. I would also be open to IT positions. So for every different kind of job I've applied for I've carefully tailored my resume to match its description. 

I signed up to ZipRecruiter and added all my skills and experience to my profile, and it generated a resume for me. Then I applied for a data entry role, and without giving me the option of uploading my own, it submitted the application with the AI generated resume packed with both relevant and irrelevant stuff. I'm now afraid that my application will get sorted straight into the ""no"" pile because of it not being specific enough. 

I know to go to the company website, find the job and apply directly there instead of using middleman websites like ziprecruiter and linkedin, but in this case the company was only advertising on sites like that. Is there any other way around it? Is it just that I'm unfamiliar with ZipRecruiter and did something wrong, or does it just suck?",1,2025-03-21 20:10:59,1,0.007334710743801659

Fake reviews of The Human Reach / Career AMP / AJ Mizes,"I was considering The Human Reach for career coaching after seeing ads about the founder, AJ Mizes, but I couldn't find any testimonials that weren't posted by his company or AJ himself. After searching for reviews on Reddit, I found a couple of suspicious ones.

One was from an account with no posting history. Odd, but not conclusive.

THEN I found another review from someone who had shared their personal email in an unrelated thread. I looked their name up on LinkedIn and... discovered they work at The Human Reach. It seems the company is posting fake reviews to boost business.

I wanted to warn job seekers‚Äîit's disappointing to see a company preying on people who are desperate for a job!

Do applications take longer for more senior level positions?,"I'm trying to get into a larger, nationwide company in my industry. They had a position open about a month ago that I was over qualified for by a few years, but applied anyway. Within a few days, someone from their talent department reached out to me to schedule a quick 15 minute phone interview. Through that conversation, she mentioned that this role was for someone with experience in a sector that I don't have experience in (wasn't mentioned in the job posting), so I figured I wouldn't move on to the next step, and sure enough, a few days later I got a generic ""you're talented and great, but blah blah blah.""

A few weeks after that, they posted another job, but it's a senior level position, which I'm very much qualified for, minus not having a certain certification that I'm in the process of getting. It's been two weeks since I applied, and no one from talent has reached out to me. Does it normally take longer for larger companies to reach out for senior level positions?

Are these ‚Äúaccount manager‚Äù positions real?,"This all started yesterday. I‚Äôve been looking for a new job for a few months after I got laid off in November but I recently took a break this month (March) to help my family out with their business. I haven‚Äôt put my resume out at all during March.

However yesterday I got two phone calls both 15 minutes apart from one another, both from counties near me. They both said they received my resumes when I ‚Äòapplied‚Äô but I don‚Äôt remember applying to these companies at all. They also both offered me interviews for a ‚Äúaccount manager‚Äù position.

This morning I get a phone call from another company, (I couldn‚Äôt catch the name it was too muffled) but they also offered me a ‚Äúaccount manager‚Äù position/interview.

Frustrated and confused after an interview,"
I‚Äôve been job hunting for a while now, and I finally landed an interview for an M&A risk insurance role. I prepared thoroughly deep research on the company, the industry, and the role. I even did multiple mock interviews with AI, to make sure I could confidently explain everything.  

During the actual interview, I gave full, detailed answers about every product they offer. At one point, the interviewer literally said, ‚ÄúWell, I guess there‚Äôs nothing to add about what the company does.‚Äù So I walked away feeling like it went really well.  

Then the recruiter calls me back with they won‚Äôt be moving forward because of a lack of preparation‚Äù and that I ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt fully discuss what the company does.‚Äù What the‚Ä¶ If I was missing something, why didn‚Äôt the interviewer push for more? Why wouldn‚Äôt they ask follow-ups? Instead, I was told I had everything covered, and then suddenly, I ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt prepared.‚Äù  

To make things even more confusing two of his colleagues viewed my LinkedIn profile after the interview. So if they weren‚Äôt considering me, why bother checking?  

I don‚Äôt mind rejection -it happens- but I just feel like this was either a generic excuse or a miscommunication. Anyone else experience something like this? Is this just a recruiter‚Äôs way of softening the blow?

Should I (candidate) apply behind my external recruiter's back?,"Let me explain,

Short version: This recruiter (jane) found me on LinkedIn and had me apply at a company (let's call it ""A corp"") twice (didn't get hired) and she ghosted me after asking me to apply for a third role at A corp. 

Long version: Jane found me on linked in and said I would be a good fit for role #1, however the role got filled up quickly, so Jane had me interview for two, different, but similar roles (#2 and#3). Needless to say, I didn't get hired, but got very good feed back and apparently A corp really likes me. Those roles I applied for where somewhat higher in the scale and they went for more seasoned applicants. This all happened during January.

On March 10th (today is march 21st) Jane reached back  as the role#1 at A corp just reopened and Acorp wanted me to interview once again. At this point I wasn't sure if it was A corp or her that wanted me to apply, but I wanted to make sure I'd get hired (finally), so i asked her how confident she was about my chances of getting hired this time. She called me next morning (Tuesday March 11th) and I let her know that even tho I got good feedback, I felt a bit self-conscious about interviewing a third time as I got rejected twice already and I wanted to know what could I do or how to prepare to better help my chances during the interview. 

Now, she doesn't work directly for them, so I thought it'd be ok to have such open and honest conversation with her and hopefully get hired as this would be a win win for both of us. She said she'd talk to someone to make sure I was a strong candidate (I'm not remembering super clearly what she actually said) and would get back to me with updates.

By Friday march 14th i hadn't heard back so i sent her a message.... Nothing. I send her a follow up message on Monday March 17th afternoon.... Nothing. Today is Friday March 21st, I haven't heard back from jane, and I'm very tempted to submit my application on their website and let the internal recruiter (Karen) know that i applied, so hopefully they keep me in mind. 

Karen and I have communicated through emails in the past about setting meetings up. That's how i got her contact information. 

Sorry for the long post, but I'd really appreciate some professional guidance on this.

Thanks,

Seeking job advice as someone new in the pharma industry,"Hello everyone!

I just transitioned out of academia and started a new position in a Pharm company this Jan,. I successfully defended my PhD in Feb. My current line manager understands that I'm overqualified for the current role, which is highly administrative, but a good stepping stone into the industry. It's also a 1 year contract role. 

I recently saw a job post within my current company and they're looking for someone to lead a specific TA program. It's a role that doesn't require a terminal degree (e.g., medical affairs or MSL), but requires at least 3 years of experience in the industry. I'm interested to apply because this specific TA was exactly what I did for my PhD, and I have relevant connections with clinicians and have good experience in hospital settings.

I'm keen to speak to the hiring manager to ask if they would consider me if I applied, as I do understand that I'm still very new in the industry. I'm not sure how to delicately approach the hiring manager, without upsetting my current line manager. I'm also not sure if doing a half-head count for both roles would be feasible/good idea, but it's definitely something I could suggest?

My observations after a month of job searching & a message to Hiring Managers and Recruiters,"My LinkedIn Premium expired, which was my official sign that it‚Äôs been a full month since I got laid off. I know a month might not seem like a long time to some, but I‚Äôve learned a lot in this process.

Key Takeaways:
	‚Ä¢	Don‚Äôt take rejection personally. Companies don‚Äôt care about your financial situation.
	‚Ä¢	Luck plays a role, but you need to put your best foot forward.
	‚Ä¢	The hiring process is flawed, subjective, and often unfair.

Observation #1: Applying everywhere is a waste of time.

When I got laid off, I applied to every job I came across, even ones I wasn‚Äôt a good fit for. Unsurprisingly, I never heard back from most of them. The truth is, sending a strong application takes 1‚Äì2 hours, and being strategic about where you apply is critical. Do some self-reflection first‚Äîfigure out what roles truly align with your skills and goals before blasting out applications.

Observation #2: Corporate hiring is a broken system.

Recruitment, and corporate America in general, is a mess. Many recruiters aren‚Äôt effective at their jobs‚Äîthey work slowly, procrastinate, and don‚Äôt see an issue with that. Understanding this is key: the system is broken, not you. Once you accept this, rejection won‚Äôt hit as hard, and you won‚Äôt let it shake your confidence.

Observation #3: The ‚ÄòUnicorn‚Äô Myth

Hiring managers are often searching for a ‚Äúunicorn‚Äù candidate‚Äîsomeone who checks every single box (which is almost never realistic). If you‚Äôre being ghosted after an interview, chances are they‚Äôre holding out for their mythical perfect hire. Ultimately, hiring decisions are highly subjective and even discriminatory‚Äîeven when all candidates are qualified, the choice often comes down to personal preference, gut feelings, or internal politics.

‚∏ª

A Message to Recruiters & Hiring Managers

Recruiters: Do better. Your role is critical, and while you may have been trained to detach from the candidates, remember that the people applying are in a vulnerable position. You don‚Äôt have to go above and beyond‚Äîjust stop ghosting. Here‚Äôs a response you can literally copy-paste to candidates instead of leaving them in the dark:

‚ÄúHello, we are still in the process of interviewing candidates and discussing. You‚Äôll hear back when we‚Äôve made a final decision.‚Äù

That‚Äôs it. A simple acknowledgment goes a long way.

Hiring Managers: The recruiter is probably waiting on you to make a decision. Encourage communication. Ghosting candidates isn‚Äôt a strategic move‚Äîit‚Äôs disrespectful to people who have researched your company, your team, and dedicated 15+ hours to this process. Set an example. One day, someone in your life‚Äîyour child, sibling, or friend‚Äîwill be in this position, and you‚Äôd want them to be treated with respect.

‚∏ª

To My Fellow Job Seekers

I see you, and I feel you. Please, please believe me when I say: the problem is the system, not you. You are valuable, you are talented, and you will find the right opportunity. Don‚Äôt get attached to a company like a toxic ex‚Äîkeep applying, put your best foot forward, and trust that the right fit will come.

Good luck. Keep going.

I saw a job opening on LinkedIn with 100 applicants in 3 hours.,What in the world?,86,2025-03-19 21:09:20,40,0.0
What the heck happened here?,"Maybe I am just venting or kind of confused...

Saw a post on Linkedin for a job that just opened that day. Very specific technical stuff that I have an awesome sounding resume specifically hitting on every bulletpoint. Application goes to their site, and I apply. It's a real company, financial industry. Not a major name but they are a global company. It was a hybrid role, and the office was close enough to me to apply.

  
The next day I am in the middle of a meeting, and I see this company is calling me. It's on my caller ID, and the area code matches up, but I can't answer. No voicemail. I call back in 20 minutes and leave a message ""I see you called, and this may be about my application I just sent over..."" Something nice and left my info and asked them to call me back. Never called me.

Phone number search also shows it belongs to someone who works for them. Checks out on Linkedin, etc.

Day 3, on Linkedin ""This job is no longer active"". Job isn't listed on their site. And my status on their site is ""No longer under consideration"".

I don't care that I didn't get the job. Or maybe it was a cancelled job since they gave it only 3 days. But what the hell is going on with a damned phone call from them. My voicemail isn't full, and it only has the system greeting not something wacky. No emails or texts from them either. Again, this isn't some goofy scam company, or a recruiter. It's bothering me that they were calling for what I don't know.

Almost 2 weeks since final interview‚Ä¶,"Applied for tech job at a small company 2/24. Initial interview was 2/26 with hr. Went well and they recommended me for the next step. Second interview was 3/3  with the same hr rep, due to the manager having an emergency that day. We went over what to expect from the role. My final interview was 3/7, with the tech director. It was supposed to be a virtual interview, but the called me instead. They spoke of how highly the hr rep spoke of me and added me on LinkedIn in. He ended the call by saying ‚Äú you have my number, if you have any questions, feel free to reachout. I‚Äôll speak with the hr rep and we‚Äôll make a decision‚Äù. A week goes by, I hear nothing, so I email the hr rep 3/14. They responded about 50 minutes later that day and said they have a meeting scheduled next week to make a decision and would keep me updated. Today is Thursday March 20, 2025 of the following week. Is it possible they have the meeting scheduled for tomorrow (friday) ? Did they go with another candidate and just not mention it to me? I went back to the job post and it was removed.

How Much Time Should You Spend Tailoring Your Resume?,"I‚Äôve been applying for jobs and experimenting with AI-powered resume tools, but I‚Äôm starting to wonder if they‚Äôre making things worse.

üîπ Most AI resume tools focus on keyword stuffing, but I want my resume to tell my story, not just trick an ATS.
üîπ Some job advice says to ‚Äòtailor every resume,‚Äô but AI tools push the ‚Äòapply everywhere fast‚Äô strategy.
üîπ I spent 2 hours with ChatGPT rewriting my resume, and while it felt stronger, I wonder if I‚Äôm overcomplicating it._

I‚Äôd love to hear from others:

‚ùì Do AI tools actually help you get interviews, or do they make resumes worse?
‚ùì Is spending extra time tailoring your resume worth it, or is speed more important?
‚ùì What‚Äôs your strategy for getting through the hiring proces?

Is it normal to get hired and still not start the job 2 weeks later?,"Exactly what the title says, 2 weeks ago I had a job interview. I have been trying to work at this place and apply for over a month now, and have been trying to get in touch with HR. I‚Äôm not going to go into details about this incident but I‚Äôve had trouble fully submitting my application because of being un-rehireable from an incident with a very rude customer which caused me to get fired for something that wasn‚Äôt even my fault. This happened more than a few years ago, same company but totally different location. I've made phone calls, and left a voicemail about applying and about the situation. 2 weeks ago I called the company and they transferred me to HR and somehow this particular time out of the many times I've been trying to follow up HR actually answered the phone. Spur of the moment, she asked me right then and there if I can come in that same day for an interview and I was surprised and I agreed. As soon as I got there we were talking about my situation and she agreed with me that the incident wasn‚Äôt my fault and happened long enough ago to where I am approved to be re-hired and she said she had a position available for a special project/merchandise position to where it was supposed to be ""temporary"" for several months, and if I do well and have good attendance and so on I could get hired on permanently and maybe move into other positions. I agreed to this and said this would be great, I'll do this. She said ""Ok great, I'll reach out to corporate about your application, you are approved to be rehired, and we'll run a background check which takes 1-2 days. Be on the lookout for an email and a phone call from me about when you can start, you got the job! I'll be in contact with you soon."" Things went great and I was hired on the spot.



This was 2 weeks ago. The interview happened at the very end of the week so I waited throughout the week of the next week and there‚Äôs been no email or phone call. I called back after about 5 business days after the interview for an update and to see what's been going on. Of course like always, no one is ever answering the phone for the HR extension or not even the main company's phone number like 99% of the time. Recently I went to the place in person to ask for someone in HR and explained my situation at the front desk saying that I already had an interview and I was hired but it's been 2 weeks and I haven't heard anything about a start date. A supervisor working at the front desk told me that HR wasn't here today and she's really busy in general, and that if I keep calling or leave a voicemail she'll get back to me. This is obviously not any real advice because I've done that already and left a voicemail maybe around a few days before I went to the place in person explaining that I was checking in for an update.



I don't know if I'm coming across as really pushy or demanding, but this is really serious right now, things have been bad for awhile, job market has been pretty much impossible and I really need to start working ASAP. I don't have time for all this uncertainty, especially if something else comes up, or if I get a call from somewhere else. Considering how much time has gone by, from my point of view, I really don't think I'm being impatient at this point because the HR person actually told me that I'm hired and I‚Äôm approved, and to look out for an email and phone call, she really did say that. She already has my info from the application. The majority of times if you get hired somewhere you usually start the job anytime within a few days of being told you're hired or maybe sometime during the week of the next week at the latest. There's been no communication at all from HR since, so I don't know if she forgot, or if she's too ""busy"" or whatever's going on but I'm really getting tired of all this uncertainty and lack of communication. I don‚Äôt know if this is the new normal now for it to take a long time later to start a job after being hired or for HR to reach back out within a reasonable amount of time in this bad job market or what. I don't know what to do.",1,2025-03-20 17:58:57,1,0.07743489843489844
Job Requirements/Job Preference expectations too high?,"Hey there,

I am hoping on here to vent, get some insight on how job hunting/career transitions are looking like for everyone else. For me? It's absolutely disheartening, discouraging, tough and (*insert any negative adjective here).*  I actually feel like this process is really emphasizing the word **hunt** in 'job hunt'. I literally feel like a cave woman hunting, scavenging, begging to get an opportunity somewhere. I spent hours drafting cover letters, tweaking my resume to suit the job I am applying to. I have submitted my application to larger organizations, smaller companies, and everywhere in between. I wake up every morning to rejection letters (*it's part of the process and I do my best to not let it stop me from continuing on with my hunt).*

I hold a master's degree in Applied Behavior Analysis, and I am currently a BCBA *Board Certified Behavior Analyst,* and can't even begin to tell you why I am wanting out of this field. But, I understand I have to start from scratch and not all my skills transfer or are applicable. I am applying at mid-level positions, and even entry level positions. I am getting rejected by jobs that are entry level (*requirements are High School Diploma)* in addition to my skills meeting some (*not all*) of the job requirement.

Came here to vent and complain about how intense it is! The job requirements/job preferences for entry level positions are so high, and the pay does not match the expectations. I especially feel deeply for the people just entering into the work force! I'm trying to keep my spirits up, but this flat out sucks!

Edit\* - I am networking with some friends to get referrals into their company. A part of me is scared and hopeless in the event of being rejected, as I am running out of ideas on how to exhaust all my resources.",3,2025-03-20 11:25:17,2,0.05728395061728396
I applied for over 2000+ jobs in the past 6 months and I can‚Äôt get hired. 31 year old male.,"I‚Äôve been applying for jobs for well over a year now, and despite having extensive work experience, I‚Äôm still struggling to land one. I‚Äôve been persistent‚ÄîI‚Äôve been working since I graduated high school‚Äîbut I didn‚Äôt finish college. However, I recently decided to take a coding boot camp to transition into software engineering, which I just started a week ago.

People often ask me, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you just get a job?‚Äù Trust me, I‚Äôm trying. I have experience in social media management, worked at Amazon for five years, and spent a good amount of time at an exotic car club and dealership. I‚Äôm also highly creative‚ÄîI write stories, compose music, and do voiceovers. I know that talents like these don‚Äôt always translate directly into stable careers, but I‚Äôm open to side hustles and different opportunities.

That being said, my mental health has taken a toll on me over the years, and I know I‚Äôm not alone in this. Many men struggle with pushing themselves, bottling up emotions, and dealing with setbacks in silence. My mental health challenges contributed to past job losses, which unfortunately doesn‚Äôt look great on my record, but life happens. I‚Äôve applied to countless places, including entry-level retail jobs like Target and H-E-B, yet I still can‚Äôt seem to get hired.

I‚Äôm doing my best to network, but it feels like every lead results in a dead end. I keep hearing, ‚ÄúSomething will come up,‚Äù but after a year of trying, my patience is wearing thin. I know I‚Äôm not the only one feeling this way, and if anyone else has been in a similar situation and found a way forward, I‚Äôd really appreciate any advice and possibility of networking with someone would also be ideal. 

Adding some context: I had an interview for Tesla in February. I did not get the job but what I can what I can  say is that I still apply for Tesla nonstop because that is my dream job and I still feel like in my mind that is one step closer.

Is it ok to go in person and ask about hiring?,"For more context, I‚Äôm 18, high school senior, had a very chill online job from a small business from my family that they hooked me up with, but never had in person work experience. I‚Äôve applied to a bunch of retail stores like Walmart, target, Albertsons, etc and yeah, now I‚Äôm on board with you guys that once everyone moved to online applications, it‚Äôs miserable for applicants because you‚Äôre just left hanging.

I want to go in person to Walmart and show initiative in my application because I really do want to start working and gaining real experience, but I‚Äôve heard varying answers online about whether or not this is a socially appropriate thing to do nowadays in 2025. No one taught me in school how to apply for a job and how to gain real life experience, and so I‚Äôve been trying to figure this out for myself.

What I want to do is show up to Walmart, ask an employee for the manager, and if I‚Äôm insanely lucky, meet with the manager and show them my LinkedIn resume, cover letter, school schedule, etc. My school day ends at 1:30, and I‚Äôm willing to literally work every afternoon starting at 2 Monday to Friday (part time, but my point is not that the hours matter, but that I really want to just start doing something ).

In summary, I‚Äôm in the position where I have no experience within the workforce but I want to start. I want to improve my life. Everyone keeps ranting about how Gen Z is so lazy, they suck at communication, they‚Äôre coddled for way too long by their parents, all that stuff. So I‚Äôm saying to myself to shape up, talk to someone, and start working. None of this submit an application online, wait 2 months, and get ghosted kind of business. Nothing will happen, and waiting around hoping something does won‚Äôt help.

I‚Äôd appreciate any advice you guys have and I would love it if you could give me pointers on my plan. I‚Äôm just 18 bro I have no idea if I‚Äôm doing it right because no one taught me how, but all I know is I gotta figure it out.

Thank you everyone, and have a great day.

Seeking guidance on how to land interviews,"Hello! I am looking for a job and because the market has been tough the recent years, I came here to ask for some advice to try to improve my odds.

**First of all, some context:**
- I'm a software engineer with a CS degree with 12 YOE living in spain
- I've been working as a CTO for the last 2 years in a startup
- almost 2 years being a team lead/engineering manager. 
- 9 years as a software engineer working on projects of all sizes. During this period, even not having the team lead title I've managed projects and people.
- I've started several projects from scratch in my last 6-7 years 
- done some personal projects (nothing remarkable)

The startup I work at told me yesterday that we are bankrupt and that my last day will be April 2th so I'm on the journey to find a job to pay my bills. My only requirements are:

- remote: i live alone and i have to take care of my dog (mandatory)
- would like to keep my income or, if possible, increase it (desirable). Currently I'm earning 52K before taxes 
- would like to work again as a team lead/engineering manager (optional)


During the last year I've applied to some job offers because I was suspecting the bankruptcy situation was very likely to happen but after 40-50 job applications i got:

 1. 3 interviews
 2. around 10 generic emails saying they will go with other candidates
 3. the remaining companies ghosted me

**My strategy so far**
in order to try to land interviews and find a job, I've done the following:

 1. Updated my cv, my webpage* and linkedin profile
 2. searched for/applied jobs at linkedin, wellfound, euremotejobs, workingnomads, hiring cafe, remoteok and levels fyi
 3. added as connection several head hunters on linkedin 

**Next steps**
these are the next steps I'm contemplating to do but I'm not sure if they are correct or they can be improved somehow:

1. change my status on linkedin to ""open to work"" and saying that due that the company is closing, i need to find another job. I have some doubts about this one because i've read positive and negative comments about saying publicly that you are open to work.
2. i have a list of great companies that are fully remote, i was thinking to send my email and a cover letter to their contact address introducing myself and explaining that if they have a job in which i may be a good fit i really would like to have an interview
3. check if there any jobs i could apply on those companies (in their website)
4. add HR/staff people from those companies to linkedin.

How do you see my approach? is it fine or can be improved somehow?

Thank you very much

How do people end up working for major companies?,"I feel like any time I look at a large company‚Äôs career page they‚Äôve got like 1 or maybe 2 postings relevant to my career. I foolishly wasn‚Äôt fully decided on what I wanted to do out of college which I think would‚Äôve been my best bet in terms of meaningful connections and networking .

My company was a sinking ship and they ended up laying off the entire department (IT) as result of budget cutting. I‚Äôm now searching again and when using popular job boards like Indeed, ZipRecruiter and LinkedIn, I‚Äôm often only seeing smaller companies. These positions also just feel like throwing shit at a wall hoping it sticks since I imagine these positions are getting 10s of thousand of applicants. If I go to larger companies I‚Äôm finding very few if any opportunities that match my skill set. Is it really all networking and I should pretty much just give up on working for any large company? I have a pretty large professional network despite my fledgling career but nobody in my network has provided anything of substance to go on. In any of my job searches since college.

"Did not get the job, due to feedback I gave..","
I recently went through a rigorous 4-stage interview process for a sales role in the UK, including an hour-long observation on the sales floor. The first three stages went exceptionally well‚ÄîI connected with the team, received positive signals about cultural fit, and felt confident about my chances.  

In the final interview with the Head of Sales, I was asked, *‚ÄúHow did you find the sales floor, and what did you learn?‚Äù* I highlighted the positives, noting similarities to my current experience and enthusiasm for the role. I also shared *constructive feedback*: observing that some client calls seemed prolonged without clear direction, and explained how I might adjust communication styles to drive outcomes. When I asked the manager for feedback on my response, he said there were no issues and that I‚Äôd hear back within 24 hours.  

Shockingly, my recruiter later relayed that the company gave *‚Äúthe worst feedback they‚Äôve seen in a long time,‚Äù* claiming I‚Äôd ‚Äúshot myself in the foot‚Äù by criticizing their process. They called it ‚Äúrude,‚Äù especially given my non-direct sales experience.  

I‚Äôm bewildered‚Äî**they explicitly asked for both positive and negative observations**, and I framed my critique respectfully, focusing on proactive solutions. Even the recruiter was stunned, saying the role was ‚Äúpractically mine‚Äù beforehand. The team also seemed to support my fit.  

Has anyone encountered this? Was this a trick question, or is there nuance I missed in delivering constructive feedback during interviews? I‚Äôm disheartened but eager to learn how to navigate this better.

I quit my job last night,"UPDATE:

Some further background, I am in an insanely good position financially. I have no student debt, live at home, and have no bills other than my phone bill, I also am on my parents health insurance for another year. Otherwise I would definitely not be able to quit without a back up plan. I didn‚Äôt see a point in being in a position that I was so unhappy in and stressed out when I have no obligation that is keeping me from just getting out. That being said, I will be working at my family‚Äôs business part time for some sort of income so I don‚Äôt deplete my savings, while I look for another full time job. This decision wasn‚Äôt random, I‚Äôve been thinking about leaving for quite some time and was looking for another job since November 2024. I was almost hired for a role and did not get it and continued to have interviews but got nowhere. I am aware how bad the job market is but I rather work a part time gig and grind out applications than be in shitty environment. That being said, I had conversations with my boss and manager and they are EXTREMELY nosy. After telling them I do not want to discuss where I am going they continued to grill me. I am making the decision to end things on good terms because you never know how things could end up in a few years. I know a lot of people made comments about how they could fire me on the spot, but I knew they wouldn‚Äôt do that because of the immense amount of work load that they rely on me for. So I am staying for the full two weeks and will be able to get paid out for my bonus and vacation time. I am pretty content with my decision and am happy to get out of a messy situation.

"Spent 41 days on a job application, created 8 illustrations ‚Äî they hired someone who just traces art","The situation itself is unpleasant, but now it‚Äôs less annoying and more amusing because of how absurd it is.

As expected, it all started right before New Year‚Äôs (I‚Äôm serious). I applied for a position at a big clothing company in my country that designs and produces clothes, mainly for young people. They were looking for a designer-illustrator for women‚Äôs clothing. Since I‚Äôm an illustrator myself and even buy clothes from this company from time to time, I know their style pretty well.

Literally two hours after applying, I got an instant rejection ‚Äî no test assignment, no nothing.

At the time, that rejection really frustrated me because I‚Äôd been job hunting for a year already, and most of the available positions either offer ridiculously low pay or expect you to be a designer-administrator-manager-mechanic-ophthalmologist (seriously, 80% of the ‚Äúillustrator‚Äù jobs in my region are actually designer + manager or social media manager, and the pay is awful). But this job stood out ‚Äî the pay was decent, and the responsibilities were reasonable.

So, I made a decision: to create my own test assignment and reach out directly to the HR department and the company‚Äôs management (before that, I‚Äôd only contacted them through a typical job site). Over the next three days, I created three clothing illustrations. On New Year‚Äôs Day, I sent them my work, hoping that after the holidays, they‚Äôd see my email and maybe get back to me.

Nope. They didn‚Äôt. Not after a week, not even after two. I only got a response after I sent a follow-up email asking why they hadn‚Äôt replied to my previous one. The first actual contact with an HR specialist happened at the end of January. Honestly, I was surprised because I figured they‚Äôd already hired someone by then ‚Äî but no. They reached out, were polite, and asked if I was still interested in doing a test assignment. I agreed. They gave me a week to complete it.

The test was to create 3‚Äì4 clothing print designs. Since I was unemployed and really wanted the job, I went all out. I finished the test in 5 days instead of 7 and created 5 designs instead of 3‚Äì4 to show that I was serious about the position. It‚Äôs worth mentioning that the test included two sample assignments ‚Äî this is important to note.

And then I waited. Up until this point, the HR specialist had been quick to respond ‚Äî either the same day or at least the next day.

Two weeks later, my patience ran out. I emailed the HR specialist again, asking if they‚Äôd made a decision and what the outcome of my test was.

Three days later, I finally got a reply: ‚ÄúWe finalized our decision a few days ago and are ready to make an offer to another candidate.‚Äù I hadn‚Äôt felt that crushed over a rejection in a long time. I‚Äôd spent 41 days chasing this position, created a total of 8 illustrations for them, and turned down several other potentially good job opportunities in the process.

But the funniest part came later. I decided to check out their new clothing collection ‚Äî and guess what? I saw designs in the new line that were identical to the test examples they had sent me initially ‚Äî the ones created specifically for that position. No, I‚Äôm not saying that their test submission was better than mine. Not at all. And this isn‚Äôt artistic jealousy ‚Äî I can‚Äôt be jealous of a test that was just a basic line-trace of a famous artist‚Äôs work.

I've applied to well over 450 jobs (I stopped keeping count) and it's been almost a year since I got laid off. The only thing I could get is a low paying job that I'm over qualified for. Mostly I feel like I'm just throwing my resume into a black hole because I often don't hear anything. I feel like LinkedIn is just full of solicitation and scams anymore. I keep seeing SO many jobs just get reposted over and over during this past year and I'm starting to wonder if any of them are even real jobs. I've rewritten my resume countless times, ran it thru AI, even had a professional writer redo it at one point. I tailor my resume and cover letters for each job. I've tried applying to things outside what I normally do and honestly am just pulling my hair out with all the conflicting advice out there.

How Do I Message Old Manager to Ask for a Job?,"Hi everyone. I think I am going to get fired from my job soon. I‚Äôve been here for 1 year and 2 months. I‚Äôm starting to apply to new positions as soon as possible.

When I found out she left, I sent her a LinkedIn message basically saying I‚Äôm sad to hear she‚Äôs gone, that I want to thank her for being such a wonderful manager during my first year at the company, and that she helped me gain confidence in this field.

Advice getting into pharmaceutical sales with no med experience?,"
How can I bridge the gap into other industries without industry specific knowledge?

TLDR; Hi everyone, 29F here, looking to get into pharmaceutical sales. I have 6 years of sales experience, 5 years in cannabis, 1 year in tobacco where I am currently, no degree but just went back to community college to finish & transfer to a 4 year for some branch of business degree to help long term job prospects. Resume and CV attached for anyone interested, would love any feedback. Currently making just over 100k yr but am aiming for a job with more potential to make 150-200k.

-


For more details, i was in cannabis for 10 years, and found an awesome company I was with for almost 5 years who gave me my first sales job. I stopped going to school, cannabis sales took off, and in 2022 I got promoted to sales manager. Industry took a turn, I resigned as sales manager after 8 months and went back into sales, so that‚Äôs why the manager position isn‚Äôt on my resume. I felt like I had way more to learn to be a good manager and I wanted the company I was with to do well.

In 2024 I decided to leave cannabis and get into something else, I applied for entry level tech, real estate, and finance jobs (bdr/cold calling stuff), and I did get some interviews, but I ended up getting hired in the tobacco industry so I took it, and my current job is pretty cool! FWIW, I noticed I got a lot more interest in my resume when I removed the word cannabis from it, but even when it was there, most recruiters were super interested that I‚Äôd been at my first sales company for 5 years. Anyway, how can I get into the pharmaceutical industry when I have zero medical field experience? For now my plan was just keep sending out the resume and crushing interviews until someone sees my greatness and gives me a chance to start building my medical field experience, but I would love any other advice you guys can offer.

Thanks everyone!

I've been having trouble getting interviews despite hundreds of applications. The only ones I have gotten are through referrals, and sometimes even the referral is not enough to get an interview. I just want to check with others if maybe I'm shooting myself in the foot.

For reference, I'm applying for entry to mid-level positions for software development or data science positions. (That said, these times are hard and I have applied for adjacent roles like data analyst, tech support, coding instructors. I've also tried applying for vacancies that are more unrelated like food services, cleaning services, warehouse labour, etc. Unfortunately, that hasn't paid off either.)

"Alright US job market, you win. I'm leaving the US. I booked a flight to Thailand to find better luck over there","I just booked a flight to Thailand, I'm leaving the US on friday, I'm a dual us/thai citizen so I can come back any time (probably not). I used a credit card to book a flight on expedia because I only have 300 dollars left in my pocket man, I don't care I'm not looking back. I have family in Thailand so it's not like I'm coming with no support. I know most people don't have that kind of privilege and luck to just up and leave and be able to come back any time, dont remind me.. If you had that kind of opportunity in the situation im in you would take it too

Graduated with a CS degree, couldn't find a job in a long time because when even Mcdonalds isn't even hiring anymore because they're posting fake job posts for cashier jobs even though cashiers do not exist anymore in my area since they replaced all of their cashiers with kiosks (just one example), you know there's much bigger problems in the us than people want you to believe and they'll call you fearmongering for bringing up specific examples, and we're basically in a recession and they'll call you doomposting...

These entry level  jobs that are suppose to be for people just entering the workforce are being sent to places like india and philippines for cheap labor or being taken by AI. Jobs that use to not require it for example data entry now require arbitrary requirements 5 years of experience and a bachelors degree. How are you suppose to get experience when these companies don't want to give you experience. You can have all of those and they'll magically find something else to disqualify you

These people are celebrating federal workers being laid off in mass.. Now federal workers are flooding the job market too, this is what 80 million people voted for

LinkedIn is corporate shilling now and people trying to make you buy their courses. Indeed job applications are sent to the void. Applying to company websites just sends you to Workday applications and we all know how bad applying to jobs using Workday is.

I gave up on my 600k subscriber Youtube channel that I worked on since high school to go back to college and get this degree to try to get a ""real job"", because if you have content creator or something on your resume no one will take you seriously, see how shit turned out? Being a social media creator takes hard work and dedication but people do not want to believe that, they think it's not a real job not knowing the amount of effort that goes into this even though I was making good money doing this at the time but it wasn't enough to live off on since I didn't go all in because of priortiizing high school and college and shit

I fell for the learn to code bullshit, so did millions of other people, look where that got me

I cannot imagine myself working a 9 to 5 until I'm 65, I'm 26, wasting away my youth for an imaginary job to hopefully come by that doesn't exist to maybe afford 5 dollar hash browns and aldi muffins for breakfast because people told me it's more respectable than being a video gamer for a living, social security will definitely not exist when I'm 65, look at what they did to pensions.

These companies do not care about you, why should I care about them? Why show these companies loyalty and respect when they aint gonna show you loyalty and respect? They dehumanize you during interview processes. They use AI to filter your job application out if you don't have the exact keywords they're looking for. They'll lay you off without hesitation and all of that ""company loyalty"" and bootlicking they sold you on will punch you right in the face, they're not gonna spare me, you'll be the first on the list to be laid off despite having stellar performance reviews and referrals, all of that fancy and shiny corporate marketing benefits of working at these jobs is just a facade it's all fake, it's to keep you obedient and deflect their problems on you, ""it's your fault you didn't meet the quota"". They do these record breaking mass layoffs claiming they need to lay people off due to ""budget cuts"" while also reporting record breaking profit at the same time spitting at these peoples faces like you believed their lies, how are you just accepting this and being taken advantage of?

Thailand couldn't possibly be worse. Being dead looks easier than what I'm going through in the us, Ive been miserable living in the us. Relationships in the us was all transactional, people expect to get something from you so relationships with these people were not genuine. I'll most definitely be happier in thailand with cost of living being cheaper and since all of my family is there, it's just me and my parents in the us.

You cannot even go to the corner store to buy snack without a car here, the nearest corner store is 35 minutes if you walk there. This place is so car dependent, you do not have legs if you don't have a car here

You can do everything right and still be told you're not doing enough and you'll be called entitled for wanting literally any job. No one is asking for a 6 figure job stop putting words in my mouth, all I'm asking is A job, I don't care what job at this point, but then see what happens?

They call you lazy and don't want to work, but they won't even give you a job in the first place. They'll say network, but networking is useless when these jobs are not even hiring, and these people know you're only networking to get a job so it feels fake. They'll tell you to upskill, I did a coding bootcamp, I went back to college and graduated, I got an internship at bank of america but they laid off thousands of people including interns, I built coding projects that thousands of people actively use, I abandoned my dream of being a Youtuber to try to get a ""real job"" because no one takes Youtubers seriously, they told me if you have that on your resume you won't be taken seriously, so look where all of that got me. They'll tell you to apply to Walmart or Mcdonalds, when I obviously did but those jobs are not even hiring. They'll tell you to set up an LLC or put a bankrupt company on your resume to cover a job gap, no one falls for that bullshit man. They'll tell you 1.8 million job openings are in the US, when these people don't even live in the US not knowing a vast majority of these job openings are fake job posts and scam jobs, jobs that have no intentions of hiring, jobs that are trying to collect all types of information about you to sell it to data brokers, etc.

No one reads cover letters anymore but I still write them after researching the company and why I would genuinely be interested in working there and my background, knowing full well no one will read it and still get ghosted. The job application process is so dehumanizing, these applications require you to do disrespectful trivias like match the card type shit for IQ tests calling them personality tests, you apply with your resume, and have to reenter everything again that's already on your resume if the job uses Workday for example, and still don't get interviewed. There's a lot more stuff that I can't be bothered listing out that's insanely disrespectful with these job applications

Advice in looking for job-stability/ leaving marketing and communications,"**TL; DR : Experienced challenging workplace culture, multiple mass layoffs in corporate America. Want to pivot to find stable income**

The job market is in a weird place and I need help figuring out what to do. I'm a 30something woman who's worked corporate jobs in marketing. I just want a stable job and the chance to do honest work for once. At some new jobs my boss or teammates wouldn't meet with me for months and I'd be alone in the office or working from home. I'd have to make up work for myself and keep reaching out to people until they finally started including me in things but never really felt ""part of the team"" if that makes sense. My male bosses were always fine but sadly, all but one of my women managers iced me out from day one, refused to meet with me and said they were too busy. I'd build relationships with coworkers and they'd like me but my managers saw this and got mad. I'd overhear them gossiping w/ my coworkers saying I wasn't smart and twisting information about work they'd never told me about to get people to stop respecting me. Well, it worked. Some nice people tried to give me things to work on but my manager would secretly finish these projects before me and leave me off emails so she could take all the credit so I never got a chance to prove myself.

It's been hard to foster important work relationships and find new work or get references for this reason. I've been told by past managers that I have an impressive resume and ""intimidating background"" (whatever that means). I went to a good school and once thought it would help me in my career but guess what, most of the time no one cares and honestly we should focus on the work people do and who they are more than their schools. However, it's been like a scarlet letter and people take one look at my LinkedIn and think that I'll be a snob or believe I'm so smart and above everyone which is crazy because now I could care less--I just worked hard like I was told would lead me to a good job one day and was extremely blessed at the time.

When layoffs come, marketing is usually one of the first departments to go. I've been fired and laid off and seen other smart, talented women be pushed out of jobs or laid off multiple times too.  I think sometimes for whatever reason, no matter how nice and helpful I try to be, people perceive me as a threat or as being different and nothing I've tried seems to be able to help that. I've worked in different industries but most of my experiences have been like this and frankly, I'm tired.

Unfair Dismissal at Teleperformance Romania ‚Äì Seeking Legal Advice,"Hello everyone,

I recently worked at Teleperformance Romania on the Expedia Group project but was unfairly dismissed under suspicious circumstances.

After completing a two-week training period and two weeks of nesting, I officially started my job. However, just three days later, I was suddenly fired. The reason given was that I was asking personal questions instead of work-related ones during nesting, which is completely false.

Here‚Äôs the issue:

	‚Ä¢	There were 15 people in my team during nesting. If I was supposedly asking personal questions and distracting the team, why was I the only one fired? Everyone was getting to know each other, laughing, and having casual conversations‚Äîbecause that‚Äôs what happens in any normal workplace. No one talks about work 100% of the time during an 8-hour shift.

	‚Ä¢	If my behavior during nesting was truly problematic, why did they wait days after nesting to fire me?

	‚Ä¢	The real reason appears to be my supervisor, Nona. She had a clear personal issue with me. During nesting, I encountered a technical issue and asked for guidance. Instead of helping, she rudely dismissed me, saying, ‚ÄúI already explained it twice,‚Äù and refused to assist.

	‚Ä¢	Shortly after, I was moved to another Teams room and informed that I was being fired. It was obvious that this was a setup.

	‚Ä¢	This same supervisor had previously mistreated at least two other employees, and everyone on the team witnessed it. She seems to be using her connections with managers to get rid of employees she personally dislikes.

I understand that companies can dismiss employees during a three-month probation period, but this was not a fair decision‚Äîit was personal and biased.

I want to defend my rights and hold this company accountable.

Does anyone know what legal actions I can take in Romania? Are there any labor rights organizations I can contact? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",0,2025-03-19 18:39:17,11,-0.07098765432098765
Please give me some hope,"Alright this might get a bit long but I feel like telling the whole story is important. Without giving away too many details I applied to a job on 1/28. After applying they invited me to a role introduction webinar and sent me a skills assessment to take. I take the skills assessment and about 3 days later I get an email saying that while they were moving forward with other candidates for the job I initially applied for they thought I would be a good fit for another role and invited me to a final round interview for that position.

So I schedule that interview which is 4 hours long (first hour is overview of company, second is roles specific, third is a case study, and 4th is a traditional interview with my recruiter). Before I have this interview they ask me to take another skills assessment which is coding specific. I do the interview which I think went well not perfect but no red flags or major issues. In the last hour of my interview my recruiter tells me I can expect to hear back in around 2 weeks. 

So the two weeks come and go and so I reach out the following week to my recruiter just following up. This company has a strong reputation of not ghosting people so I wasn‚Äôt worried about that so much but just wanted an update. I get a response about a week after (week 4 at this point) saying that they had been out of the office for a little over a week and that I could expect a final decision by the end of the week.

So and if the week comes and I get an email saying they still hadn‚Äôt made a decision yet and didn‚Äôt provide me with a timeline for when I might hear back. 

So that‚Äôs where I‚Äôm at right now and I just don‚Äôt know what to think. I feel like if it was a no or they thought it might be they would just come out and say it rather than delaying the decision. But if it was a yes I don‚Äôt know why it would be taking so long (also the company typically sends out a background check which I didn‚Äôt receive so also on my mind).

New Job Blues or Deeper than that?,"Hi everyone,

Started a new job this week and was something I was really excited about and ticked all the boxes of a job I‚Äôd love to give a try to take my career to the next level. It‚Äôs a promotion for me which means more money, more holiday hours and flexibility in managing my own week.

The role was brought up to me by a few individuals who believed I may be a good fit and I read more about it and sounded good and so I went for it and have been successful in securing the position.

Can anyone recommend any investments they've felt achieved a noticeable impact on their job search? I'm open to tools, information, events, etc.

The $100 is just a suggestion btw. If something drastically improves this experience for me I'd be happy to spend more.",0,2025-03-19 14:08:41,1,0.19261038961038962
Searching for new jobs only,"Hey all, I'm job hunting right now, and one of the biggest challenges I am running into is the complete inability to truly get access to ""new"" job postings. Even when you use the filters on various sites like LinkedIn for ""posted within the last 24 hours,"" it's just constantly reposts of the same jobs over and over that already have hundreds if not thousands of applicants. I've been playing around with Google Alerts, with no luck.

Is there some magic solution I'm unaware of that can truly help you identify newly-posted jobs? ",1,2025-03-19 13:41:19,2,0.11356421356421355
"I'm Really Starting to Hate My Job, Debating on Quitting Without One Lined Up","To provide some context, I work as an Assistant Property Manager at a family-owned Commercial Real Estate Property Management Company where the CEO personally owns all the properties. Before I left for vacation, I made sure to send out all the default letters. In total, I had over 10 letters to send, plus one posted on the door, and two that were certified mailed. Honestly, there were so many that I lost track, but from what I can tell, we‚Äôre heading into a downturn, as about half of them will likely result in lockouts.

However, I apparently missed 3 letters before I left. One was due to a missing check in the mail, which I was hoping would show up while I was away. The other two were situations that seemed so unusual, I thought they would have been resolved by the time I returned, especially since I had received emails from the tenants promising payment, but they didn‚Äôt follow through.

The Property Manager has been on my case about it, which I understand, but I‚Äôve already told her I‚Äôd send the default letters. I got a lot of questions like, ""Why wasn‚Äôt this done? Why didn‚Äôt you send out the default letter?"" At this point, it feels pointless to explain. Our policies are so vague and up to interpretation that it‚Äôs hard to justify anything. Even when I try to explain, the Property Manager treats me like I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing. For example, we send a default letter, and then if a tenant wants to pay half, we can choose to accept or decline. Sometimes we accept, sometimes we don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs not consistent.

Honestly, I‚Äôm just done, and I kind of want to be fired at this point. I‚Äôm trying to stick it out until I find something else, but despite applying to countless jobs, I either get rejection emails or hear nothing back. I‚Äôve rewritten my resume multiple times, and I just don‚Äôt know what else to do.

Seems too good to be true; and it might be. Is this a scam?,"I‚Äôm usually REALLY good at figuring out whether a job posting is legit or not, but I just can‚Äôt wrap my head around this one too much.

Seems like a LOT for just a helpdesk position, but maybe it‚Äôs a higher tier of helpdesk.

The company has a website, LinkedIn page, and actual employees associated with the company‚Äôs LinkedIn page, so I‚Äôm inclined to say it‚Äôs legit.

"Funding has been withdrawn from my charity job, not sure what to do. Any advice?","**TL/DR at the bottom of post.**

I currently work for a small charity in Scotland as an administrator and I have been for just shy of two years - it will be two years in June.

Our charity runs on funding to support the work we do which is working with children/young people and their families through therapeutic work. We assist families who have gone through trauma such as domestic and sexual abuse, fleeing war torn countries. We have been around since 1931 and we have built up an extremely positive rapport within the community and city and even beyond that. 

I absolutely love my job and the people are lovely. However, we got some news last week that the funding we have has been withdrawn just shy of the full contract. Everyone, as you can imagine, is heart broken and devastated. We are aware of cuts being made to social work and health, but this is a massive hit to us. Our manager is speaking to the MSP of our area and he is angry and annoyed that this has happened, even calling it ""unethical and cruel"". He was there when the same people tried to cut our funding by 54% several years ago. He fought and and they ended up giving us all our funding back.

Here is some information:

* Teachers are not happy and they are upset that the service is being cut and runs the risk of closing down due to the lack of funding and many are going to the head of education to discuss this as they are aware the importance of the service. 
* Another mental health organisation who send us referrals are devastated and said that they would not be able to cope nor provide the service we do if we were to close. 
* Letters have gone out to head of education and health by the MSP as a matter of urgency.
* the case is going to be brought up in parliament either this Thursday or next - depends on other matters that are being brought up.
* Senior journalists have been spoken to and two are interested in covering the story and are waiting for a clear run in covering it so it gets as much attention as possible. Some parents (current and past service users) are happy to be covered in the story and are absolutely outraged this could happen as they think favourably of the service.

The board are speaking about talking about redundancies but only as a precaution. The funders are going to cover us until June and that is when all funding from them will cease. We have been given statutory funding by these same people since the 1960s. 

It is not 100% clear that we will be shutting down and our manager is working really hard to make sure that we can get the funding re-instated until the end of the contract so we can then get the opportunity to look for other ways to fund our service. 

Here is my issue: I don't want to jump ship just yet, but I am aware what is against us. I am currently looking for other jobs and getting a feel of what is out there and I have spoken to recruitment agencies to make them aware of my situation. One of which is the lady who got me the job in the first place and she is very understanding and said she has temp work to keep me going if she can't find a permanent job first. I feel it is too early to make a call but I don't want to be here when it is clear that the ship cannot be saved but that can take some time before I know if that is the case. 

I am only 26 years old so I feel like there are options out there for me, but it is just a horrible situation to be in. Either way, I know I am going to have to look for another job if the place is going to close anyway. I keep wondering if the job is secure. Someone I work with is really positive in saying she has been in the industry for 30 years and she said that she is not worried as something always works out. 

**TL/DR: Our funding has been cut and we are fighting hard to re-instate the funding so we can look for something else. I am not sure if I should just cut my loss and look for somewhere else or see it plays out.** ",1,2025-03-19 11:28:02,1,-0.002525252525252523

Need help regarding structuring the 'Skills' section in LinkedIn.,"So, Ive basically graduated high school and expecting uni results, meaning im practically free for most of the day for the next few months and wanted to utilize my time. I decided building a linkedin profile to find some potential low level internships/volunteering work, just to kill my time.

I am at a loss at what to put as skills. Ive completed most of the sections and added as many skills I think are covered in them, eg, including leadership in my high school education as I served the student council as president, including software development in my low-level internships at small local companies, etc, etc.

But browsing through linkedin ive basically come across two profiles- a) people who max out the number of skills, often with only one reference to the skill, eg, leadership but its a high reach as they just interned at an hr department, and similar other exaggerations, and b) People who only include two - three skills which are demonstrated by various sections in their profiles.

This is not to say the profile (a) doesnt have skills without demonstrations, there are two to three primary skills that have 6-7 references. But when you look at profile (b) it just seems more confident and impressive. It feels like the user doesnt need to fluff and is confident about his/her skills.

Can someone explain to me the pros and cons of each type of profile and which one I should choose",1,2025-03-19 10:58:57,5,0.19187500000000002

Most obnoxious job description I've ever seen on linkedin,"**Learning curve vs. doing curve**

Jan here, the COO. I don‚Äôt believe in preemptive learning. What you‚Äôve learned so far doesn‚Äôt really matter. No one will ask you about it. How many amazing things did you learn in your second semester of university? Or in 11th-grade math class? It‚Äôs all quickly forgotten.

I believe in doing.What have you done? Because what you will do at Buena is something no one can ever take away from you. I also believe that learning is downstream from doing. You‚Äôll be able to say that you brought a company with 10 employees from a 5% margin to 40% while increasing revenue. You won‚Äôt need to say that you learned to understand financial data, manage employees, or sell services. It'll be implicitly clear.

I Don‚Äôt Care What You‚Äôve Learned Before Or What You Want To Learn Here. I Leave That To The Academic World. What Matters To Us Is That You‚Äôll Do a Lot Here

*  People management, including recruiting: Motivate your portcos (portfolio companies), help them achieve their goals, and decide with the team lead who gets hired and when.
*  Creating and improving operations and processes: Each property management company has unique characteristics that you‚Äôll need to represent in professional and scalable processes.
*  Product development: New features are constantly built to handle more property management tasks even more effectively in our software. You can lead such a feature from idea to deployment, its first use in a portfolio company, and finally its rollout across Buena.
*  Property management: Here, you‚Äôll work hands-on with the largest asset class in the world‚Äîand gain insights into what to consider when purchasing your own real estate. Not the most useless knowledge to acquire.

The above example is the main action for 2025. Once you have successfully integrated your set of 5-8 portcos, the playbook for integrations will be so good, we'll be able to have interns do this job. You will then move on to the next stage: increasing revenue per unit. There are a bunch of industries within residential real estate that are adjacent to property management and could be interesting. One example is insurance. Instead of having every property manager get their own deals with insurers via external insurance brokers, you could negotiate one - much better - deal for all our units directly with Allianz CEO Oliver B√§te‚Äîat the Champions League final against Chelsea.Once you have a deal you'll test it with your portcos, integrate it into the product and finally roll it out across all portcos - and grow this business unit as Buena changes property management globally (starting with the US as the second market after Germany).

**Work directly with the Leadership Team**

Anyone Joining Us As a Venture Builder Will Work Directly With The Leadership Team. One Could Say That You‚Äôll Learn a Lot From This, But As Mentioned Above, That‚Äôs Secondary. Primarily, Working With The Leadership Team Means Two Things

*  You can do a lot: Your direct supervisor has the autonomy to approve everything and empower you to act quickly. To get a better understanding for what that means exactly ask the Venture Builder you‚Äôll meet in our recruiting process about how budgets work here.
*  You can grow with the company: In a few years, I'll need senior execs responsible for areas like Banking, Insurance, Brokerage, etc. I want to prepare you for this development so that‚Äîeven when Buena reaches ‚Ç¨100 million or ‚Ç¨10 billion in revenue‚Äîyou continue to report directly to the Leadership Team. Or secure their angel investment for your own startup. #PaypalMafia

**Your first week at Buena**

9:00 ""Here's your laptop; I've assigned you a Linear project where you'll find everything you need to get started.""You spend about 30 minutes reading ‚Äúeverything‚Äù you need to know beforehand.

9:34 ""Your first two companies are our new portfolio companies in Magdeburg and Hamburg. This afternoon, you‚Äôll have an initial call with each team lead. Here are two documents containing everything you need to know about the companies.""

9:51 You go through the Buena software and review additional onboarding documents to get more context. This includes introductions to property management, our software, and materials from the last two board meetings.

11:00 You talk with Maria, the Hamburg team lead. She briefly introduces her team of 8 employees. You discuss the software currently in use and plan to meet in person tomorrow. She asks if our software can generate reports, as they have a major owner with 340 units (‚Ç¨30 is the minimum revenue per unit per month) who receives a monthly report. You request a sample report. Currently, these are being laboriously created in Excel. You find out that generating these reports takes half a workday each month.

12:00 Lunch break

12:45 You speak with Jakob, our Product Manager, to understand our progress on such reports. The sample report is a simple overview of all units, occupancy status, and outstanding rents. Jakob explains our previous thoughts on the matter, and together you brainstorm where this function could be integrated into Buena. The result: it will take just two days of development to enable these reports at the push of a button.

14:00 You talk with Markus, the Magdeburg team lead. He primarily needs help with recruiting, as new units were recently added. Swift action is required here‚Äîmaybe the new units can be added directly to the Buena software and managed from there?

15:04 You book transport and hotels for two days in Hamburg and two days in Magdeburg.

15:41 You receive the financial data for your two companies to get an overview. Together, total revenue is ‚Ç¨1.2 million annually. Your task will be to increase the margin from 4% to 35% through the integration of Buena software and subsequent growth in units.

17:29 You talk with Anna, our recruiter, about the situation in Magdeburg. She‚Äôs already aware, and the job posting is live. The first 10 candidates have already been contacted. Together, you plan to conduct the initial interviews on-site when you‚Äôre there.

18:06 You grab some food, and the Ops team eats together downstairs. Most have meal-prepped to save time and eat healthily.

19:00 You go over the import template. It‚Äôs a .csv file which you need to fill (via scripts or copy-pasting) to import master data from portcos into the Buena.

20:46 You walk eight minutes home to pack your things‚Äîtomorrow, you're off to Hamburg.",1,2025-03-19 06:38:01,0,0.19022727272727274

How I Make Up to $2K per Commission Working Just a Few Hours a Week,"Hey everyone! I wanted to share a side hustle that‚Äôs been a total game-changer for me: selling life insurance (I focus on helping families secure coverage and build wealth). I know it might sound intimidating at first, but here‚Äôs why I love it:

	‚Ä¢	High Earning Potential: I typically earn around $2K in commission per sale. Working just 3 hours a week, I‚Äôm on track to make $50K a year‚Äîand that‚Äôs with minimal time invested. If you put in more hours, the sky‚Äôs the limit.
	‚Ä¢	Work from Anywhere: All you really need is a phone and internet connection. I‚Äôve literally taken calls and closed deals while traveling‚Äîso there‚Äôs tons of flexibility.
	‚Ä¢	Your Own Schedule: No fixed hours or office requirements. Whether you want a small side income or you‚Äôre aiming for a full-time gig, you can do it at your own pace.
	‚Ä¢	No Sales Experience Needed: You do need to get licensed (which is pretty straightforward), but beyond that, most companies offer training and mentorship. I started with zero sales background, and I‚Äôve learned everything on the job.

How it Works: You help people protect their families and finances by connecting them with policies that fit their needs (like Indexed Universal Life). When they decide to sign up, you earn a commission. It‚Äôs fulfilling because you‚Äôre helping folks secure their future while also earning a solid income yourself.

I‚Äôm not dropping any referral links or anything like that‚Äîjust sharing my personal experience in case someone‚Äôs looking for a legit way to boost their income. If you have any questions about the licensing process, commissions, or day-to-day details, feel free to ask!",0,2025-03-19 11:10:08,6,0.206474358974359

Fine with me. My mistake. I did not realize this program needs so much work on the back end, as well as needing to be better integrated into the company. This program is essentially a resource to our clients- where the revenue comes from client referrals, re-admissions, etc. so it doesn‚Äôt inherently make money on its own.

My company doesn‚Äôt elevate titles. Are job prospects killed by a weak title?,"I work for a white collar office company of <10 people that is very flat.  Most of us report to the president, there is only one middle manager. Only one person has their title in their email signatures.

I‚Äôve been there for 4 years with increasing role complexity but haven‚Äôt received any title change.  This wouldn‚Äôt bother me but the title I started with is junior in the eyes of recruiters.

Do you recommend pushing on this hard in negotiation?  Ideally I‚Äôd like a new job and skip any more negotiating with this firm but it feels like the weak title is kind of keeping me hostage.

I asked for a new title end of 2023 but they ignored me. I didn‚Äôt have a ton of leverage at the time because our company wasn‚Äôt doing great and I was happy to just keep getting a paycheck.

It seems completely logical to work there because they give you days and holidays off plus there‚Äôs also customer service and I get to talk to people and customers. ü§ë 

but then again I‚Äôve had a SHIT experience at my past office job with the environment plus I get bored if I stare at a screen all day long.

BUT I‚Äôm also applying to work at a GAS station and I think I have more of a chance of getting hired there. I love talking to customers because I already have experience with working with food because my mom is a street vendor and I always help her. The downside for that one is that it could be sketchy and even though I wanna take the morning shift, I could still get robbed ‚ò†Ô∏è and I don‚Äôt know how flexible they are with days off and all that jazz. And tbh idk if the pay will be well. üòì


In a nutshell, I think I‚Äôd just have to wait for whoever hires me first ‚òπÔ∏è because I DESPERATELY need a job to pay off my loans for cosmetology school AND pay for supplies I need while doing my client hours at school. I‚Äôm so nervous bc ive applied everywhere and im just desperate. ",1,2025-03-18 13:50:48,2,0.00416666666666667
